Our project is about creating a database and system to store and virtually run AI games of the social deduction game Blood on the Clocktower. The database can be used to store full scripts or compositions of the various character roles in the game. Then, using semi-random AI and Python to code in the specific behaviors corresponding to the roles, we could be able to run a very loose simulation of a social deduction game with specifically chosen sets of roles. We can then take the data we recieve from our AI games and average it to apply further attributes and make inferences on the various role distributions within the game as a whole.
