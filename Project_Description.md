- Our project will be based around video games. The database will hold different types of games. Games will have attributes that like name, publisher, genre, year published and their publishers. They will also have a basic plot summaries and have info about the main characters. Users can sort through the games in the DB by genre or publisher. Users can also add games and info to the database, and if they see any information they believe wrong, they can change it.
