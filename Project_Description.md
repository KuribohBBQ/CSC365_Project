- Our project will be based around video games. The database will hold different types of games. Games will have attributes that like name, publisher, genre, year published and their publishers. They will also have a basic plot summaries and have info about the main characters. Users can sort through the games in the DB by genre or publisher. Users can also add games and info to the database, and if they see any information they believe wrong, they can change it. 

Here's my (Will's) idea:
There's this social deduction party game called Blood on the Clocktower. It's like Mafia or Werewolf, but has a wide variety of roles that the good and evil team can use to gain information on each other or influence the game state (think Town of Salem, if you've heard of/played that before). These games are run with "scripts", which basically list all of the possible distributable player roles of any given round of the game.  We could, first of all, make a database that stores and is able to sort and search for these combinations of character roles for making specific, interesting, or balanced games. Then, we could possibly take it a step further and, by programming the role behaviors in python and referencing specific scripts using our database, we could run specific simulations of games and calculate win rate, etc.
