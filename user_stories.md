User Stories:
1. As a professional gamer, gambler, and statistician, I want to examine the statistics and win rates of various roles so that I can know the odds of victory at all times.
2. As a game master with too little time to prepare, I want to run a very quick simulation of the script I am going to run so that I can check for any last-minute blindspots. 
3. As a game master for a group of players that consistently lose to the evil team, I want to find a script that has the odds favored for the good team so that the game is balanced.
4. As a script writer, I want to see how the addition of a character (such as the Slayer) to my custom script can alter the balance of the game so that I can decide whether to actually implement it or not.
5. As a social and humorous gamer, I want to create ridiculous scenarios and memes within the system so that I can humor myself and my friends.
6. As an experimental and inventive game designer, I want to see how far I can push the limits of the system in hopes of creating a completely unrecognizable and new but still playable and entertaining experience.
7. As a strategic player, I want to compare the win rates of my in-person group and the AI simulation of the same scripts so that I can see if a random-choice strategy is viable.
